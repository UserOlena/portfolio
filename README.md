# Portfolio
>The development of the Portfolio website was part of the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp Challenge 2. This website comprises a hero image, a navigation bar that includes different sections such as home, about, resume, portfolio, blog, and contact, and a small avatar image located at the center. All of the mentioned sections are included in the website. The development of the application was done accordingly to [user story](#user-story) and [acceptance criteria](#acceptance-criteria).

## Setup
There is no need for installation as the web application is readily available for use [_here_](https://userolena.github.io/portfolio/)


## Usage
- To navigate to a specific section, the user can simply click on the corresponding link in the navigation bar, which will take them directly to that section.
- The project names and images on the Portfolio website are interactive, and when clicked, they will redirect the user to the deployed version of the corresponding project.
- On the mobile version of the Portfolio website, the user needs to toggle the navigation bar to expand the links and access the different sections of the website.


## Features
- When a user clicks on a navigation link on the Portfolio website, they will be directed to the corresponding section of the website. This helps users easily navigate to the information they are interested in.
- In the mobile version of the Portfolio website, the navigation links are hidden by default to save space. To access the links, the user needs to click on the nav menu icon, which will expand the navigation menu and display the links.
- The navigation bar on the Portfolio website has a fixed position, which means that it remains in place and will stick to the top of the screen even when the user scrolls down the page content. This allows users to easily access the navigation links at any point while browsing the website.
- The project names and images on the Portfolio website are interactive, and when clicked, they will redirect the user to the deployed version of the corresponding project.
- In each project section on the Portfolio website, there is an interactive link located at the bottom that will redirect the user to the repository of that specific project. This allows users to view the source code and contribute to the project if they wish to do so.
- On the Portfolio website, the small avatar image located at the center of the navigation bar is interactive and has a special feature. When the user scrolls down the page and the avatar image reaches the top of the screen, it will fade out and be replaced with the name of the portfolio owner. When the user scrolls back up and the navigation bar returns to its original position, the avatar image will fade back in. It's worth noting that this feature is only available on screen sizes that are at least 850 pixels wide.
- The contact information on the Portfolio website is also interactive and provides several options for users to reach out. By clicking on the email address, the user's default email app will open, allowing them to send an email. Clicking on the phone number will prompt the user's mobile device to initiate a call. Finally, clicking on the GitHub link will redirect the user to the portfolio owner's GitHub account.
- In the footer section of the Portfolio website, there is an interactive GitHub icon that, when clicked, will redirect the user to the portfolio owner's GitHub account. This provides users with an additional way to access the portfolio owner's projects and information on GitHub.
